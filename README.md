## UX

### Site Goals

The Pizza PY website is designed to promote the Pizza PY restaurant, a family-run Italian restaurant specializing in pizzas. 
The intention of the site is for visitors to book a table after viewing the food and the menu. This converts visitors into customers/patrons
for the restaurant.

### Design Choices

For the purpose of our Italian restaurant's website, we chose pizza themed colours. This included green, red, and yellow, as well as a dark 
grey and an off-white to complement. We chose these colours for continuity between the images featured in the gallery and the branding of the site. 
The images used were also taken from photographers around the world, rather than being made with AI, to better show the pizza topic.

### Wire Frames
