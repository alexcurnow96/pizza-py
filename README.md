### Features Left to Implement

  

- Another feature idea

  

## Testing

  

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your project’s features and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

  

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

  

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

  

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

  
  

### Validator Testing

  

- HTML

- No errors were returned when passing through the official [W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fcode-institute-org.github.io%2Flove-running-2.0%2Findex.html)

- CSS

- No errors were found when passing through the official [(Jigsaw) validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2Fvalidator.w3.org%2Fnu%2F%3Fdoc%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fcode-institute-org.github.io%252Flove-running-2.0%252Findex.html&profile=css3svg&usermedium=all&warning=1&vextwarning=&lang=en#css)

  

### Unfixed Bugs

  

You will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a big variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation is not a valid reason to leave bugs unfixed.

  

## Deployment

  

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub)

  

- The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows:

- In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab

- From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch

- Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.

## Credits

  

In this section you need to reference where you got your content, media and extra help from. It is common practice to use code from other repositories and tutorials, however, it is important to be very specific about these sources to avoid plagiarism.

  

You can break the credits section up into Content and Media, depending on what you have included in your project.

## Other General Project Advice

  

Below you will find a couple of extra tips that may be helpful when completing your project. Remember that each of these projects will become part of your final portfolio so it’s important to allow enough time to showcase your best work!

  

- One of the most basic elements of keeping a healthy commit history is with the commit message. When getting started with your project, read through [this article](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) by Chris Beams on How to Write a Git Commit Message

- Make sure to keep the messages in the imperative mood

  

- When naming the files in your project directory, make sure to consider meaningful naming of files, point to specific names and sections of content.

- For example, instead of naming an image used ‘image1.png’ consider naming it ‘landing_page_img.png’. This will ensure that there are clear file paths kept.
